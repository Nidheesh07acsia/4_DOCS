## AIM
To develop a wireless orchestra. A baton will be held by musicians. An instrument will be allocated to each baton. To control the instrument, the musician will move the baton.
The baton's accelerometer and gyroscope will enable the identification of a variety of movements that can operate the instruments. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is used to control the virtual instruments. The sounds can be played using an open source MIDI sequencer like fluidsynth.
The WirelessOrchestra application will receive events from the batons and send the MIDI
commands to the MIDI sequencer
