## AIM
To develop a wireless orchestra. A baton will be held by musicians. An instrument will be allocated to each baton. To control the instrument, the musician will move the baton. The baton's accelerometer and gyroscope will enable the identification of a variety of movements that can operate the instruments. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is used to control the virtual instruments. The sounds can be played using an open source MIDI sequencer like fluidsynth. The WirelessOrchestra application will receive events from the batons and send the MIDI
commands to the MIDI sequencer.


## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Requirements must be S.M.A.R.T Specific. Measurable. Attainable (appropriate, actionable, achievable). Realistic. Testable and Traceable
- The baton should produce musical notes.
- The baton should be wireless.
- It should recognize gestures.
- Multiple batons should be able to work in parallel.
- The baton should have a button to switch instruments.
- The latency should be less than or equal to 100 milliseconds.
- It should support multiple types of instruments: percussion, wind, and strings
